## What is The Quantumist?

The goal of The Quantumist is to explain difficult topics in an easy way, without the bulky mathematical overhead of papers and textbooks. In particular, we'd like to address those roadblocks that took us a while to grasp, proposing some insight to better undestand the theory. We hope you'll be able to build something even without going through all the theoretical little details.

Our articles are written for beginners or simply curious minds. As such, you may sometimes find them lacking in detail or rigor. Fear not! Since every article talks about published and publicly accessible material we include the sources, and youseful pointers if you want to dive deeper. Nevertheless, we hope to build a comprehensive and self-contained library of articles over time, so to turn The Quantumist into a solid resource for everyone interested in learning cutting edge research topics.

We talk about complex things and we don't claim to be experts. As such, it's possible (and probable) we make some mistakes along the way. Please let us know about any errors you encounter by commenting under a post or emailing us. We are really looking forward to knowing people that share our passions, so if you'd like to suggest us a topic to consider in an article or you simply want to contact us, do not hesitate to do so!
