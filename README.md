## Purpose

Repository of XXX and relative deployment pipeline. XXX is a blog with the purpose of explaining difficult topics in an easy to understand way, without the bulky mathematical overhead of papers and textbooks. In particular, we'd like to address those roadblocks that took us a while to understand, proposing you some insight to make use of all the theory. In this way we hope you'll be able to build something even without going through all the theoretical little details.

Our articles are written for beginners or simply curious minds. As such, you may find them sometimes lacking in details or rigor. Fear not! Every article also includes the sources we adapted it from, allowing you to explore these topics in more depth. Nevertheless, we hope to build a comprehensive and self-contained library of articles over time, so that all you may need may be found on XXX.
