<h2 id="github-actions-docs">GitHub Actions docs</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Actions</a> listed under GitHub features.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions">Actions</a> under GitHub help.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>

<p>Some available actions for your workflow.</p>

<p>Also try a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&amp;query=jekyll">Jekyll</a> search in the GitHub Marketplace.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll--github-pages-actions">Jekyll + GitHub Pages actions</h3>

<p>Links are for the GH Actions Marketplace</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-actions">Jekyll Actions</a> - used by this project. It is a docker-based action.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-action-ts">Jekyll Action TS</a> - a fork of the above but with TypeScript and without Docker, so it is lighter.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-deploy-gh-pages">Jekyll Deploy GH Pages</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="starter-workflows">Starter workflows</h3>

<p>If you create a new action through the Actions tab, you’ll see this Jekyll action there. You might have to click the <em>more…</em> button.</p>

<p>That action references <a href="https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/master/ci/jekyll.yml">jekyll.yml</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows">actions/starter-workflows</a> repo.</p>

<p>That unfortunately does’t provide any info though on what you do after a successful build in terms of publishing and viewing results.</p>

<p>This Action was not used for this site and is not covered in more detail.</p>
