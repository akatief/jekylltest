<h2 id="tutorial-on-jekyll-docs">Tutorial on Jekyll docs</h2>

<p>To learn how to setup a Jekyll / GitHub Actions / GitHub Pages integration, see the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/">GitHub Actions</a> guide on the Jekyll docs site.</p>

<p>This project was actually developed as part of the processing of writing that step-by-step guide and there is a link at the end of the doc back to this repo.</p>

<h2 id="extra-details">Extra details</h2>

<p>Some details not mentioned in that guide but which I still want to share.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Links
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action">helaili/jekyll-action</a> repo which by <a href="https://github.com/helaili">helaili</a>, a staff member at GitHub. The instructions there cover optional input values.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action/blob/master/entrypoint.sh">entrypoint.sh</a>
        <ul>
          <li>This covers the shell commands which are run in the build, including use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>. This is useful to see what would happen on the remote environment, for example file and directory references for inputs and outputs. Also it shows how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> is actually used in the container.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Subdirectory usage
    <ul>
      <li>The action mentioned above will build from any directory which contains a config file. This is usually the root but can be a subdirectory, such as is the case for this repo.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dotenv file
    <ul>
      <li>If you need to set values in the environment locally, you could do this with an ignored <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file at the root. Youâ€™ll have to to load that into the shell. Some plugins will read from a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file though. In this case the only environment variable needed is one needed to actually run the action and build to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch, so this project has no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
